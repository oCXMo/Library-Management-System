--Library Management System

--Description:
--We need to store a lot of information in the library database: return dates, members' names, books available, and much more. For this purpose, we should create tables --and match their columns with the correct data types.

--Objectives:
--The table book contains information about all the books in the library: title, author's name, genre, number of pages and year of publication, rating, and how many ----books are available.
--The student and staff tables include information about the employees who issue books and readers.
--The operation table includes information about transactions that have occurred: who issued the book and to whom, and the date of issue (iss_date), as well as the --planned return date (return_date) and the return indicator (return_indicator, issued — 0, returned — 1).
